## iTrellis Assignment

The project goals are simple: We require a program that calculates the expenses for a group of students who like to go on road trips.

The group agrees in advance to share expenses equally... Your job is to compute, from a list of students and their personal expenses from the trip, the minimum amount of money that must change hands in order to equalize (within one cent) all the students' costs.

The output should include each student's name, and how much each student needs to pay out to any others.
